                    <p>Welcome! The teachers of this class are Tal Ledeniov and Cristina Kaddouh.</p>
                    <p>Today's language (or markup) is HTML, which is a markup language.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Programming</strong>: Programming is telling the computer instructions through weird English.</li>
                        <li><strong>Web Dev</strong>: Web Dev stands for Web development, which is the way programmers (people who program) make websites. That's what you will be learning today!</li>
                        <li><strong>Inspect element</strong>: Inspecting a webpage's code can be fun, and in fact, there is a way to do it. You can right click on the element you want to see the code of, and press Inspect Element or Inspect. This will bring up lots of code. Congratulations! Now you can browse a website's code. Now, if you want to get to that page even faster, you can use a short cut. Press Command+Option+i on a Mac or Ctrl+Shift+i on Windows. This will bring up a JavaScript console, where you can run JavaScript. Go to the top and click Elements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Today's Language (or markup language)</strong>: Today you're going to learn HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to build the structure in a website. Without HTML, your language would look completely white. A markup language means that language is not exactly is not exactly a language. HTML files have the file suffix .html--That symbolizes that that file is a HTML file.</li>
                        <li><strong>HTML Template</strong>: All webpages start with a specific pattern. The pattern is below.<br>
                        <code id="code-1"></code>
                        </li>
                </article>
